They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
      "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
      "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",
      "They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\n",
      "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",
      "So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\n",

      "Question: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.\n",
      "In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.\n",
      "In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.\n",
      "In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.\n",
      "After one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.\n",
      "After the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.\n",
      "After the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.\n",
      "So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.\n",
      "Thus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.\n",

      "Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.\n",
      "He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.\n",
      "Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.\n",
      "He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15\n",
      "After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.\n",
      "These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\n",
      "He sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\n",
      "In total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\n",
      "Since his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\n",

      "Question: In a certain school, 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball, but only 1/5 of the female students like to play basketball. What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\n",
      "Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.\n",
      "So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.\n",
      "And there are 2 x 200 = 400 females.\n",
      "Hence, 600 x 2/3 = 400 males play basketball.\n",
      "And 400 x 1/5 = 80 females play basketball.\n",
      "A total of 400 + 80 = 480 students play basketball.\n",
      "Therefore, 1000 - 480 = 520 do not like to play basketball.\n",
      "The percentage of the school that do not like to play basketball is 520/1000 * 100 = 52\n",
